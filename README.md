Busy-Bee Board: Productivity Board for Students

Designed for time management and project organization for college students, Busy-Bee is a productivity board coded in PHP, Javascript, and HTML/CSS, that utilizes a mySQL database to store, edit, and delete agenda cards and is universally accessible from all devices.  Students will be able to create an account to log into. Within a single board, students can create “cards” of to-do tasks. Each card can be edited, or delete upon completion.  

Features to meet requirements:
Will be a public website that one can log into
Will create user-based accounts (through PHP and mySQL)
Through backend, will create/delete/update cards for each user.
Backend will be dynamic as tasks are moved/finished
